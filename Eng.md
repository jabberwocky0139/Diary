# クライミング系
- I'm working on this green pink problem. This is my first day working on this problem.
- I tried to do a flag left foot, but it kind of got me lost when I made that first right hand move.
- So I switched it to a heel hook on that right.
- Once I decided on those next holds, it was just kind of keeping my feet on enough to go for those next big moves.
- I didn't expect to go for the cross move, but when I up there, it just kind of felt right.
- This problem gave me a lot of trouble until I figured out like a foot switch beta.
- This beta allowed me to like stay in close to the wall.
- I feel like it is one of the hardest pink problem in the gym.
- But it also just because I'm not very good at climbing slab generally.
- It's kind of scary when you get up to the top because you know it's like not the best crimp but the next hold is pretty good.
- I really like crimps.
